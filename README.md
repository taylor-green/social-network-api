# Social-Networking-API


## About The Project
This project is a NoSQL-based social networking API that allows users to connect with each other, share their thoughts, and react to thoughts. It is built using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, following the MVC architecture pattern.

This API provides various endpoints for creating users, adding thoughts, adding reactions to thoughts, managing friend connections, and retrieving user and thought data. A user can create an account, post their thoughts, add reactions to thoughts, and establish friend connections with other users.

The backend server defines API routes for handling the different requests made by on the client side. It uses controllers to handle the logic for user and thought operations and interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.


## Code and Technologies Used
Express.js Node.js MongoDB Mongoose
